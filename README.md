<h1 align="center">Hello everyone👋, This is Mehdi Safarian.</h1>
<h3 align="center">Yet another Software Engineer</h3>
<h4>Welcom to my profile.</h4>
<p>
When I was a child, i was spending a huge of my time with the computers, at age 17 i went to vocational school and learned about computer programming,
after that in university, my interest in computer sience became more and more, till now im a junior software engineer. I want to use tools and technologies to create things, aka applications to help people and myself to have better life.
I have tried AI and Computer vision before, but I don't have that much interest in them, maybe because I'm not good at math.
Thanks for reading this.
